# Voice-Based-Age-Classification

Voice-based age classification is the task of determining the age group of a person based on their voice characteristics. It is a subfield of speaker recognition and has various applications, including automatic age estimation, personalized voice services, and age-related research.

We have discussed various aspects of voice-based age classification. We started with data preprocessing steps, including loading audio files, extracting features such as spectrograms or MFCCs, and converting them into suitable input formats for machine learning models. We also used techniques like data augmentation to enhance the model's performance.

We then delved into building and fine-tuning models for age classification. We explored different architectures, including RNNs, LSTMs, and CNNs, and discussed their advantages and limitations for this task. We implemented models using popular frameworks such as Keras and PyTorch.

Furthermore, we touched upon strategies for handling imbalanced datasets, such as random undersampling, and how to evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. We also reasearchd on techniques like learning rate scheduling and the use of pre-trained models for transfer learning.
